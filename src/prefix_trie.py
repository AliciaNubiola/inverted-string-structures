Create TrieNode class with __slots__ for memory efficiency
Create PrefixTrie class with:

String inversion function
Insert: Invert string, add character by character to trie
Search: Navigate trie with inverted pattern, collect all matches
Range search: Prefix-based collection
Delete: Recursive deletion with cleanup
Memory usage: Recursive calculation


Ensure O(m) insertion and search complexity
